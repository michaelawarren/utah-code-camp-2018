# what is the goal of TDD
the goal is not about testing
two main goals
* break the big problem into smaller problem that you can solve
    * tool for problem decomposition
* simpler and easier to maintain code

# Three rules of TDD
* first must have a failing unit test
* not allowed to write more of a unit test then is sufficient to fail
* You are not allowed to write any more production code then is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test

# Red Green Refactor
pattern to do while doing tdd
* RED - start with failing unit test
* GREEN - fix failed test
* Refactor - simplify, rename, remove duplication, extract methods, etc...
    * change form not function

# Do the simplest thing that could possibly work

# code kata
turn things into muscle memory.
