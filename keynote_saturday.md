# the incredible Disappearing Data Scientist
Washington DC
no institutional standard yet.
Data science -> python and go
## hype
* highly needed skill
* odd mixture of skills
* pay scale
    * 125000 - 150,000
* skill set became more volatile. salary dropped
* data science issues.
* hype -> anxiety
## The work of data science
* natural language processing
    * plagiarism detection
    * adding tags
    * supply chain
        * graph
        * purposeful obfuscation
* money is in very domain specific applications/data
* lots of manual labor goes into it.
* inconsistent structure
* large move to open source tools due to better integration between tools
## Instead, lets steer
* more about how to let the human steer the model instead of removing the human from the equation
* Feature analysis > algorithm selection > hyperparameter tuning
* http://bit.ly/2abVNrl
* yellow brick is a machine learning visualization
## Teams
* data scientist interacting with engineers
* data scientist cannot be isolated from engineering teams. They should be integrated
* migrate data scientist developers.
* Build and deploy phase
* you can't just higher data scientist.
## The future
* Data science is going to disappear
    * developers are being more and more required to understand stats
    * democratization of statistics tools
* data science -> decision science -> data products pipeline is slow.
* Solve specific problems
    * out of small and simple things will great things come to pass?
    * the small problems will result into solutions to large problems
